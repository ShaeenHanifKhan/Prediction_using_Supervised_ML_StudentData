# Prediction_using_Supervised_ML_StudentData
Supervised Machine Leaning - Simple Linear Regression

This is a small dataset that contains percentage scores of 25 students based on the number of hours they have studied.
We have just two varibales Scores & Hours.
We will be creating a simple linear regression model to predict the percentage a student may obtain if they study for the given number of hours.

As a part of GRIP from The Sparks Foundation, dataset is directly taken from the given URL. Adding the downloaded .csv file for reference.
#Language - Python
#IDE - Anaconda - Jupyter Notebook
